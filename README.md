# House-price-prediction
This is a Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition - [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition.  
In this [Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/SWAPKR/House-price-prediction-kaggle/blob/master/House%20price%20Prediction.ipynb) you will get to learn different data visualization
techniques and strategies for feature selection. I have used various Python library to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning opertation on it.

## Installation Guide
